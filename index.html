                    <p>African Salad (locally known as Abacha) is one of the meals mostly prepared and enjoyed by the Igbo speaking people of Nigeria. Its native taste is so distinctive, making it a delicacy to be enjoyed by all. It is usually served as a side dish in special events such as traditional weddings,funerals, anniversaries or the visit of a speacial guest. It is best served with Palm Wine, a local drink tapped from special Palm Trees, but you can also enjoy it with any chilled drink of your choice.  </p> <br>
